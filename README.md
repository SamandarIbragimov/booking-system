# Booking System Microservices

**Booking System** is a small portfolio project designed to demonstrate microservices and distributed system concepts.

The system currently includes:

- **BookingService** (implemented in .NET)
- **NotificationService** (planned in Python) â€” will handle sending notifications to users when bookings are confirmed or cancelled.

The project follows **Clean Architecture** principles and is structured to easily add additional microservices in the future.
